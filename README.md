# SleepApnea

Sleep Apnea is defined as a serious sleep disorder that occurs when a personâ€™s breathing is interrupted during sleep.
People with untreated sleep apnea stop breathing repeatedly during their sleep, sometimes even up to a hundred times. 
As a result, the organs of the body including the brain are deprived of the necessary oxygen required for normal functioning.
We have used Matlab to detect Sleep Apnea.
